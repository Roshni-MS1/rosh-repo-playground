Systems like Data Factory, Data Share, and Power BI capture the lineage of data as it moves. Custom lineage reporting is also supported via Atlas hooks and REST API.\\n\\nLineage collection\\n\\nMetadata collected in Azure Purview from enterprise data systems are stitched across to show an end to end data lineage. Data systems that collect lineage into Purview are broadly categorized into following three types.\\n\\nData processing system\\n\\nData integration and ETL tools can push lineage in to Azure Purview at execution time. Tools such as Data Factory, Data Share, Synapse, Azure Databricks, and so on, belong to this category of data systems. The data processing systems reference datasets as source from different databases and storage solutions to create target datasets. The list of data processing systems currently integrated with Purview for lineage are listed in below table.\\n\\nCopy activity\\n\\nData flow activity\\n\\nExecute SSIS package activity |\\n| Azure Synapse Analytics |\\n\\nCopy activity\\n\\nData flow activity |\\n| Azure Data Share |\\n\\nShare snapshot |\\n\\nData storage systems\\n\\nDatabases & storage solutions such as SQL Server, Teradata, and SAP have query engines to transform data using scripting language. Data lineage from stored procedures is collected in to Purview and stitched with lineage from other systems.\\n\\n| Data storage system | Supported scope |\\n| ---------------------- | ------------|\\n| Teradata | Stored procedures\\n\\nData analytics & reporting systems\\n\\nData systems like Azure ML and Power BI report lineage into Azure Purview. These systems will use the datasets from storage systems and process through their meta model to create BI Dashboard, ML experiments and so on.\\n\\n| Data analytics & reporting system | Supported scope |\\n| ---------------------- | ------------|\\n| Power BI | Datasets, Dataflows, Reports & Dashboards\\n\\nGet started with lineage\\n\\n[!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RWxTAK]\\n\\nLineage in Purview includes datasets and processes. Datasets are also referred to as nodes while processes can be also called edges:\\n\\nDataset (Node): A dataset (structured or unstructured) provided as an input to a process. For example, a SQL Table, Azure blob, and files (such as .csv and .xml), are all considered datasets. In the lineage section of Purview, datasets are represented by rectangular boxes.\\n\\nProcess (Edge): An activity or transformation performed on a dataset is called a process. For example, ADF Copy activity, Data Share snapshot and so on. In the lineage section of Purview, processes are represented by round-edged boxes.\\n\\nTo access lineage information for an asset in Purview, follow the steps:\\n\\nIn the Azure portal, go to the Azure Purview accounts page.\\n\\nSelect your Azure Purview account from the list, and then select Launch purview account from the Overview page.\\n\\nOn the Azure Purview Home page, search for a dataset name or the process name such as ADF Copy or Data Flow activity.

They can also add users into other Purview roles on collections where they\\'re admins.\\n\\nData source admins - can manage data sources and data scans.\\n\\nData curators - can create, read, modify, and delete catalog data assets and establish relationships between assets.\\n\\nData readers - can access but not modify catalog data assets.\\n\\nWho should be assigned to what role?\\n\\n|User Scenario|Appropriate Role(s)|\\n|-------------|-----------------|\\n|I just need to find assets, I don\\'t want to edit anything|Data Reader|\\n|I need to edit information about assets, assign classifications, associate them with glossary entries, and so on.|Data Curator|\\n|I need to edit the glossary or set up new classification definitions|Data Curator|\\n|My application\\'s Service Principal needs to push data to Azure Purview|Data Curator|\\n|I need to set up scans via the Purview Studio|Data Source Admin, plus at least Data Reader or Data Curator on the collection where the source is registered.|\\n|I need to enable a Service Principal or group to set up and monitor scans in Azure Purview without allowing them to access the catalog\\'s information |Data Source Admin|\\n|I need to put users into roles in Azure Purview | Collection Admin |\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"./media/catalog-permissions/collection-permissions-roles.png\" alt-text=\"Chart showing Purview roles\" lightbox=\"./media/catalog-permissions/collection-permissions-roles.png\":::\\n\\nUnderstand how to use Azure Purview\\'s roles and collections\\n\\nAll access control is managed in Purview\\'s collections. Purview\\'s collections can be found in the Purview Studio. Open your Purview account in the Azure portal and select the Purview Studio tile on the Overview page. From there, navigate to the data map on the left menu, and then select the \\'Collections\\' tab.\\n\\nWhen an Azure Purview account is created, it starts with a root collection that has the same name as the Purview account itself. The creator of the Purview account is automatically added as a Collection Admin, Data Source Admin, Data Curator, and Data Reader on this root collection, and can edit and manage this collection.\\n\\nSources, assets, and objects can be added directly to this root collection, but so can other collections. Adding collections will give you more control over who has access to data across your Purview account.\\n\\nAll other users can only access information within the Azure Purview account if they, or a group they\\'re in, are given one of the above roles. This means, when you create an Azure Purview account, no one but the creator can access or use its APIs until they are added to one or more of the above roles in a collection.\\n\\nUsers can only be added to a collection by a collection admin, or through permissions inheritance. The permissions of a parent collection are automatically inherited by its subcollections. However, you can choose to restrict permission inheritance on any collection. If you do this, its subcollections will no longer inherit permissions from the parent and will need to be added directly, though collection admins that are automatically inherited from a parent collection can\\'t be removed.\\n\\nAssign permissions to your users\\n\\nAfter creating an Azure Purview account, the first thing to do is create collections and assign users to roles within those collections.\\n\\nCreate collections\\n\\nCollections can be customized for structure of the sources in your Purview account, and can act like organized storage bins for these resources. When you\\'re thinking about the collections you might need, consider how your users will access or discover information. Are your sources broken up by departments? Are there specialized groups within those departments that will only need to discover some assets? Are there some sources that should be discoverable by all your users?\\n\\nThis will inform the collections and subcollections you may need to most effectively organize your data map.\\n\\nNew collections can be added directly to the data map where you can choose their parent collection from a drop-down, or they can be added from the parent as a sub collection. In the data map view, you can see all your sources and assets ordered by the collections, and in the list, the source\\'s collection is listed.\\n\\nFor more instructions and information, you can follow our guide for creating and managing collections.\\n\\nA collections example\\n\\nNow that we have a base understanding of collections, permissions, and how they work, let\\'s look at an example.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"./media/catalog-permissions/collection-example.png\" alt-text=\"Chart showing a sample collections hierarchy broken up by region and department.\" border=\"true\":::\\n\\nThis is one way an organization might structure their data: Starting with their root collection (Contoso, in this example) collections are organized into regions, and then into departments and subdepartments. Data sources and assets can be added to any one these collections to organize data resources by these regions and department, and manage access control along those lines. There\\'s one subdepartment, Revenue, that has strict access guidelines, so permissions will need to be tightly managed.\\n\\nThe data reader role can access information within the catalog, but not manage or edit it. So for our example above, adding the Data Reader permission to a group on the root collection and allowing inheritance will give all users in that group reader permissions on Purview sources and assets. This makes these resources discoverable, but not editable, by everyone in that group. Restricting inheritance on the Revenue group will control access to those assets. Users who need access to revenue information can be added separately to the Revenue collection.\\nSimilarly with the Data Curator and Data Source Admin roles, permissions for those groups will start at the collection where they\\'re assigned and trickle down to subcollections that haven\\'t restricted inheritance. Below we have assigned permissions for several groups at collections levels in the Americas sub collection.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"./media/catalog-permissions/collection-permissions-example.png\" alt-text=\"Chart showing a sample collections hierarchy broken up by region and department showing permissions distribution.\" border=\"true\":::\\n\\nAdd users to roles\\n\\nRole assignment is managed through the collections. Only a user with the collection admin role can grant permissions to other users on that collection. When new permissions need to be added, a collection admin will access the Purview Studio, navigate to data map, then the collections tab, and select the collection where a user needs to be added. From the Role Assignments tab they will be able to add and manage users who need permissions.\\n\\nFor full instructions, see our how-to guide for adding role assignments.\\n\\nLegacy permission guide\\n\\n[!NOTE]\\nThis legacy collection guide is only for Purview accounts created before August 18, 2021. Instances created after that time should follow the guide above.\\n\\nThis article describes how Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented in Azure Purview\\'s Data Plane for Purview resources created before August 18th.\\n\\n[!IMPORTANT]\\nThe principal who created a Purview account is automatically given all data plane permissions regardless of what data plane roles they may or may not be in. For any other user to do anything in Azure Purview they have to be in at least one of the pre-defined Data Plane roles.\\n\\nAzure Purview\\'s pre-defined legacy Data Plane roles\\n\\nAzure Purview defines a set of pre-defined Data Plane roles that can be used to control who can access what in Azure Purview. These roles are:\\n\\nPurview Data Reader Role - Has access to the Purview portal and can read all content in Azure Purview except for scan bindings\\n\\nPurview Data Curator Role - Has access to the Purview portal and can read all content in Azure Purview except for scan bindings, can edit information about assets, can edit classification definitions and glossary terms, and can apply classifications and glossary terms to assets.\\n\\nPurview Data Source Administrator Role - Does not have access to the Purview Portal (the user needs to also be in the Data Reader or Data Curator roles) and can manage all aspects of scanning data into Azure Purview but does not have read or write access to content in Azure Purview beyond those related to scanning.\\n\\nUnderstand how to use Azure Purview\\'s legacy Data Plane roles\\n\\nWhen an Azure Purview Account is created, the creator will be treated as if they are in both the Purview Data Curator and Purview Data Source Administrator Roles. But the account creator is not assigned to these roles in the role store. Azure Purview recognizes that the principal is the creator of the account and extends these capabilities to them based on their identity.\\n\\nAll other users can only use the Azure Purview Account if they are placed in at least one of these roles. This means that when an Azure Purview Account is created, no one but the creator can access the account or use its APIs until they are put in one or more of the previous defined roles.\\n\\nPlease note that the Purview Data Source Administrator role has two supported scenarios. The first scenario is for users who are already Purview Data Readers or Purview Data Curators that also need to be able to create scans. Those users need to be in two roles, at least one of Purview Data Reader or Purview Data Curator as well as being placed in the Purview Data Source Administrator Role.\\n\\nThe other scenario for Purview Data Source Administrator is for programmatic processes, such as service principals, that need to be able to set up and monitor scans but should not have access to any of the catalog\\'s data.\\n\\nThis scenario can be implemented by putting the service principal in the Purview Data Source Administrator Role without being placed in any of the other two roles. The principal won\\'t have access to the Purview Portal but that is o.k. because it\\'s a programmatic principal and only communicates via APIs.\\n\\nPutting users into legacy roles\\n\\nSo the first order of business after creating an Azure Purview account is to assign people into these roles.\\n\\nThe role assignment is managed via Azure\\'s RBAC.\\n\\nOnly two built-in control plane roles in Azure can assign users roles, those are either Owners or User Access Administrators. So to put people into these roles for Azure Purview one must either find someone who is an Owner or User Access Administrator or become one oneself.\\n\\nAn example of assigning someone to a legacy role\\n\\nGo to https://portal.azure.com and navigate to your Azure Purview Account\\n\\nOn the left-hand side click on \"Access control (IAM)\"\\n\\nThen follow the general instructions given here\\n\\nLegacy role definitions and actions\\n\\nA role is defined as a collection of actions. See here for more information on how roles are defined. And see here for the Role Definitions for Azure Purview\\'s roles.\\n\\nGetting added to a legacy Data Plane Role in an Azure Purview account\\n\\nIf you want to be given access to an Azure Purview Account so you can use its studio or call its APIs you need to be added into an Azure Purview Data Plane Role. The only people who can do this are those who are Owners or User Access Administrators on the Azure Purview Account. For most users the next step is to find a local administrator who can help you find the right people who can give you access.\\n\\nFor users who have access to their company\\'s Azure portal they can look up the particular Azure Purview Account they want to join, click on its \"Access control (IAM)\" tab and see who the Owners or User Access Administrators (UAAs) are. But note that in some cases Azure Active Directory groups or Service Principals might be used as Owners or UAAs, in which case it might not be possible to contact them directly. Instead one has to find an administrator to help.\\n\\nLegacy - who should be assigned to what role?\\n\\n|User Scenario|Appropriate Role(s)|\\n|-------------|-----------------|\\n|I just need to find assets, I don\\'t want to edit anything|Purview Data Reader Role|\\n|I need to edit information about assets, put classifications on them, associate them with glossary entries, etc.|Purview Data Curator Role|\\n|I need to edit the glossary or set up new classification definitions|Purview Data Curator Role|\\n|My application\\'s Service Principal needs to push data to Azure Purview|Purview Data Curator Role|\\n|I need to set up scans via the Purview Studio|Purview Data Source Administrator Role plus at least one of Purview Data Reader Role or Purview Data Curator Role|\\n|I need to enable a Service Principal or other programmatic identity to set up and monitor scans in Azure Purview without allowing the programmatic identity to access the catalog\\'s information |Purview Data Source Administrator Role|\\n|I need to put users into roles in Azure Purview | Owner or User Access Administrator |\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"./media/catalog-permissions/collection-permissions-roles-legacy.png\" alt-text=\"Chart showing Purview legacy roles\" lightbox=\"./media/catalog-permissions/collection-permissions-roles-legacy.png\":::\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\nNow that you have a base understanding of collections, and access control, follow the guides below to create and manage those collections, or get started with registering sources into your Purview Resource.\\n\\nHow to create and manage collections\\n\\nPurview supported data sources' metadata={'source': 'C:/Users/roshnipatil/OneDrive - Microsoft/GitHub_new/test/catalog-permissions.md'}\n",

For this reason, you don\\'t have to follow the rest of the instructions. If your private network has network security group rules set to deny all public internet traffic, you\\'ll need to add some rules to enable Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) access. Follow the instructions to do so.\\n\\nThese instructions are provided for accessing Azure Purview securely from an Azure VM. Similar steps must be followed if you\\'re using VPN or other VNet Peering gateways.\\n\\nGo to your VM in the Azure portal, and under Settings, select Networking. Then select Outbound port rules, Add outbound port rule.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/catalog-private-link/outbound-rule-add.png\" alt-text=\"Screenshot that shows adding an outbound rule.\":::\\n\\nOn the Add outbound security rule pane:\\n\\nUnder Destination, select Service Tag.\\n\\nUnder Destination service tag, select AzureActiveDirectory.\\n\\nUnder Destination port ranges, select *.\\n\\nUnder Action, select Allow.\\n\\nUnder Priority, the value should be higher than the rule that denied all internet traffic.\\n\\nCreate the rule.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/catalog-private-link/outbound-rule-details.png\" alt-text=\"Screenshot that shows adding outbound rule details.\":::\\n\\nFollow the same steps to create another rule to allow the AzureResourceManager service tag. If you need to access the Azure portal, you can also add a rule for the AzurePortal service tag.\\n\\nConnect to the VM and open the browser. Go to the browser console by selecting Ctrl+Shift+J, and switch to the network tab to monitor network requests. Enter web.purview.azure.com in the URL box, and try to sign in by using your Azure AD credentials. Sign-in will probably fail, and on the Network tab on the console, you can see Azure AD trying to access aadcdn.msauth.net but getting blocked.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/catalog-private-link/login-fail.png\" alt-text=\"Screenshot that shows sign-in fail details.\":::\\n\\nIn this case, open a command prompt on the VM, ping aadcdn.msauth.net, get its IP, and then add an outbound port rule for the IP in the VM\\'s network security rules. Set the Destination to IP Addresses and set Destination IP addresses to the aadcdn IP. Because of Azure Load Balancer and Azure Traffic Manager, the Azure AD Content Delivery Network IP might be dynamic. After you get its IP, it\\'s better to add it into the VM\\'s host file to force the browser to visit that IP to get the Azure AD Content Delivery Network.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/catalog-private-link/ping.png\" alt-text=\"Screenshot that shows the test ping.\":::\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/catalog-private-link/aadcdn-rule.png\" alt-text=\"Screenshot that shows the Azure A D Content Delivery Network rule.\":::\\n\\nAfter the new rule is created, go back to the VM and try to sign in by using your Azure AD credentials again. If sign-in succeeds, then the Azure Purview portal is ready to use. But in some cases, Azure AD redirects to other domains to sign in based on a customer\\'s account type. For example, for a live.com account, Azure AD redirects to live.com to sign in, and then those requests are blocked again. For Microsoft employee accounts, Azure AD accesses msft.sts.microsoft.com for sign-in information.\\n\\nCheck the networking requests on the browser Networking tab to see which domain\\'s requests are getting blocked, redo the previous step to get its IP, and add outbound port rules in the network security group to allow requests for that IP. If possible, add the URL and IP to the VM\\'s host file to fix the DNS resolution. If you know the exact sign-in domain\\'s IP ranges, you can also directly add them into networking rules.\\n\\nNow your Azure AD sign-in should be successful. The Azure Purview portal will load successfully, but listing all the Azure Purview accounts won\\'t work because it can only access a specific Azure Purview account.

Similar steps must be followed if you\\'re using VPN or other VNet Peering gateways.\\n\\nGo to your VM in the Azure portal, and under Settings, select Networking. Then select Outbound port rules > Add outbound port rule.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/catalog-private-link/outbound-rule-add.png\" alt-text=\"Screenshot that shows adding an outbound rule.\":::\\n\\nOn the Add outbound security rule pane:\\n\\nUnder Destination, select Service Tag.\\n\\nUnder Destination service tag, select AzureActiveDirectory.\\n\\nUnder Destination port ranges, select *.\\n\\nUnder Action, select Allow.\\n\\nUnder Priority, the value should be higher than the rule that denied all internet traffic.\\n\\nCreate the rule.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/catalog-private-link/outbound-rule-details.png\" alt-text=\"Screenshot that shows adding outbound rule details.\":::\\n\\nFollow the same steps to create another rule to allow the AzureResourceManager service tag. If you need to access the Azure portal, you can also add a rule for the AzurePortal service tag.\\n\\nConnect to the VM and open the browser. Go to the browser console by selecting Ctrl+Shift+J, and switch to the network tab to monitor network requests. Enter web.purview.azure.com in the URL box, and try to sign in by using your Azure AD credentials. Sign-in will probably fail, and on the Network tab on the console, you can see Azure AD trying to access aadcdn.msauth.net but getting blocked.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/catalog-private-link/login-fail.png\" alt-text=\"Screenshot that shows sign-in fail details.\":::\\n\\nIn this case, open a command prompt on the VM, ping aadcdn.msauth.net, get its IP, and then add an outbound port rule for the IP in the VM\\'s network security rules. Set the Destination to IP Addresses and set Destination IP addresses to the aadcdn IP. Because of Azure Load Balancer and Azure Traffic Manager, the Azure AD Content Delivery Network IP might be dynamic. After you get its IP, it\\'s better to add it into the VM\\'s host file to force the browser to visit that IP to get the Azure AD Content Delivery Network.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/catalog-private-link/ping.png\" alt-text=\"Screenshot that shows the test ping.\":::\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/catalog-private-link/aadcdn-rule.png\" alt-text=\"Screenshot that shows the Azure A D Content Delivery Network rule.\":::\\n\\nAfter the new rule is created, go back to the VM and try to sign in by using your Azure AD credentials again. If sign-in succeeds, then the Azure Purview portal is ready to use. But in some cases, Azure AD redirects to other domains to sign in based on a customer\\'s account type. For example, for a live.com account, Azure AD redirects to live.com to sign in, and then those requests are blocked again. For Microsoft employee accounts, Azure AD accesses msft.sts.microsoft.com for sign-in information.\\n\\nCheck the networking requests on the browser Networking tab to see which domain\\'s requests are getting blocked, redo the previous step to get its IP, and add outbound port rules in the network security group to allow requests for that IP. If possible, add the URL and IP to the VM\\'s host file to fix the DNS resolution. If you know the exact sign-in domain\\'s IP ranges, you can also directly add them into networking rules.\\n\\nNow your Azure AD sign-in should be successful. The Azure Purview portal will load successfully, but listing all the Azure Purview accounts won\\'t work because it can only access a specific Azure Purview account. Enter web.purview.azure.com/resource/{PurviewAccountName} to directly visit the Azure Purview account that you successfully set up a private endpoint for.\\n\\nDeploy self-hosted integration runtime (IR) and scan your data sources.\\n\\nOnce you deploy ingestion private endpoints for your Azure Purview, you need to setup and register at least one self-hosted integration runtime (IR):\\n\\nAll on-premises source types like Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, SAP, and others are currently supported only via self-hosted IR-based scans. The self-hosted IR must run within your private network and then be peered with your virtual network in Azure.\\n\\nFor all Azure source types like Azure Blob Storage and Azure SQL Database, you must explicitly choose to run the scan by using a self-hosted integration runtime that is deployed in the same VNet as Azure Purview ingestion private endpoint.\\n\\nFollow the steps in Create and manage a self-hosted integration runtime to set up a self-hosted IR. Then set up your scan on the Azure source by choosing that self-hosted IR in the Connect via integration runtime dropdown list to ensure network isolation.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/catalog-private-link/shir-for-azure.png\" alt-text=\"Screenshot that shows running an Azure scan by using self-hosted IR.\":::\\n\\n[!IMPORTANT]\\nIf you have created your Azure Purview account after 18th August 2021, make sure you download and install the latest version of self-hosted integration runtime from Microsoft download center.\\n\\nFirewalls to restrict public access\\n\\nTo cut off access to the Azure Purview account completely from the public internet, follow these steps.

      "page_content='title: Azure Purview private endpoints frequently asked questions (FAQ)\\ndescription: This article answers frequently asked questions about Azure Purview private endpoints.\\nauthor: zeinam\\nms.author: zeinam\\nms.service: purview\\nms.subservice: purview-data-catalog\\nms.topic: how-to\\nms.date: 05/11/2021\\n\\nCustomer intent: As an Azure Purview admin, I want to set up private endpoints for my Azure Purview account for secure access.\\n\\nFAQ about Azure Purview private endpoints\\n\\nThis article answers common questions that customers and field teams often ask about Azure Purview network configurations by using Azure Private Link. It\\'s intended to clarify questions about Azure Purview firewall settings, private endpoints, DNS configuration, and related configurations.\\n\\nTo set up Azure Purview by using Private Link, see Use private endpoints for your Azure Purview account.\\n\\nCommon questions\\n\\nCheck out the answers to the following common questions.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the purpose of deploying the Azure Purview account private endpoint?\\n\\nThe Azure Purview account private endpoint is used to add another layer of security by enabling scenarios where only client calls that originate from within the virtual network are allowed to access the account. This private endpoint is also a prerequisite for the portal private endpoint.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the purpose of deploying the Azure Purview portal private endpoint?\\n\\nThe Azure Purview portal private endpoint provides private connectivity to Azure Purview Studio.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the purpose of deploying the Azure Purview ingestion private endpoints?\\n\\nAzure Purview can scan data sources in Azure or an on-premises environment by using ingestion private endpoints. Three other private endpoint resources are deployed and linked to Azure Purview managed resources when ingestion private endpoints are created:\\n\\nBlob is linked to an Azure Purview managed storage account.\\n\\nQueue is linked to an Azure Purview managed storage account.\\n\\nnamespace is linked to an Azure Purview managed event hub namespace.\\n\\nCan I scan data through a public endpoint if a private endpoint is enabled on my Azure Purview account?\\n\\nYes. Data sources that aren\\'t connected through a private endpoint can be scanned by using a public endpoint while Azure Purview is configured to use a private endpoint.\\n\\nCan I scan data through a service endpoint if a private endpoint is enabled?\\n\\nYes. Data sources that aren\\'t connected through a private endpoint can be scanned by using a service endpoint while Azure Purview is configured to use a private endpoint.\\n\\nMake sure you enable Allow trusted Microsoft services to access the resources inside the service endpoint configuration of the data source resource in Azure. For example, if you\\'re going to scan Azure Blob Storage in which the firewalls and virtual networks settings are set to selected networks, make sure the Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account checkbox is selected as an exception.\\n\\nCan I access Azure Purview Studio from a public network if Public network access is set to Deny in Azure Purview account networking?\\n\\nNo. Connecting to Azure Purview from a public endpoint where Public network access is set to Deny results in the following error message:\\n\\n\"Not authorized to access this Purview account. This Purview account is behind a private endpoint. Please access the account from a client in the same virtual network (VNet) that has been configured for the Purview account\\'s private endpoint.\"\\n\\nIn this case, to open Azure Purview Studio, either use a machine that\\'s deployed in the same virtual network as the Azure Purview portal private endpoint or use a VM that\\'s connected to your CorpNet in which hybrid connectivity is allowed.\\n\\nIs it possible to restrict access to the Azure Purview managed storage account and event hub namespace (for private endpoint ingestion only) but keep portal access enabled for users across the web?\\n\\nNo. When you set Public network access to Deny, access to the Azure Purview managed storage account and event hub namespace is automatically set for private endpoint ingestion only. When you set Public network access to Allow, access to the Azure Purview managed storage account and event hub namespace is automatically set for All Networks. You can\\'t modify the private endpoint ingestion manually for the managed storage account or event hub namespace manually.\\n\\nIf public network access is set to Allow, does it mean the managed storage account and event hub namespace can be publicly accessible?\\n\\nNo. As protected resources, access to the Azure Purview managed storage account and event hub namespace is restricted to Azure Purview only. These resources are deployed with a deny assignment to all principals, which prevents any applications, users, or groups from gaining access to them.\\n\\nTo read more about Azure deny assignment, see Understand Azure deny assignments.\\n\\nWhat are the supported authentication types when you use a private endpoint?\\n\\nAzure Key Vault or Service Principal.\\n\\nWhat private DNS zones are required for Azure Purview for a private endpoint?\\n\\nFor Azure Purview account and portal private endpoints:\\n\\nprivatelink.purview.azure.com\\n\\nFor Azure Purview ingestion private endpoints:\\n\\nprivatelink.blob.core.windows.net\\n\\nprivatelink.queue.core.windows.net\\n\\nprivatelink.servicebus.windows.net\\n\\nDo I have to use a dedicated virtual network and dedicated subnet when I deploy Azure Purview private endpoints?\\n\\nNo. However, PrivateEndpointNetworkPolicies must be disabled in the destination subnet before you deploy the private endpoints. Consider deploying Azure Purview into a virtual network that has network connectivity to data source virtual networks through VNet Peering and access to an on-premises network if you plan to scan data sources cross-premises.\\n\\nRead more about Disable network policies for private endpoints.\\n\\nCan I deploy Azure Purview private endpoints and use existing private DNS zones in my subscription to register the A records?\\n\\nYes. Your private endpoint DNS zones can be centralized in a hub or data management subscription for all internal DNS zones required for Azure Purview and all data source records. We recommend this method to allow Azure Purview to resolve data sources by using their private endpoint internal IP addresses.\\n\\nYou\\'re also required to set up a virtual network link for virtual networks for the existing private DNS zone.\\n\\nCan I use Azure integration runtime to scan data sources through a private endpoint?\\n\\nNo. You have to deploy and register a self-hosted integration runtime to scan data by using private connectivity. Azure Key Vault or Service Principal must be used as the authentication method to data sources.\\n\\nWhat are the outbound ports and firewall requirements for virtual machines with self-hosted integration runtime for Azure Purview when you use a private endpoint?\\n\\nThe VMs in which self-hosted integration runtime is deployed must have outbound access to Azure endpoints and an Azure Purview private IP address through port 443.\\n\\nDo I need to enable outbound internet access from the virtual machine running self-hosted integration runtime if a private endpoint is enabled?\\n\\nNo. However, it\\'s expected that the virtual machine running self-hosted integration runtime can connect to your instance of Azure Purview through an internal IP address by using port 443. Use common troubleshooting tools for name resolution and connectivity testing, such as nslookup.exe and Test-NetConnection.\\n\\nWhy do I receive the following error message when I try to launch Azure Purview Studio from my machine?\\n\\n\"This Purview account is behind a private endpoint. Please access the account from a client in the same virtual network (VNet) that has been configured for the Purview account\\'s private endpoint.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s likely your Azure Purview account is deployed by using Private Link and public access is disabled on your Azure Purview account. As a result, you have to browse Azure Purview Studio from a virtual machine that has internal network connectivity to Azure Purview.\\n\\nIf you\\'re connecting from a VM behind a hybrid network or using a jump machine connected to your virtual network, use common troubleshooting tools for name resolution and connectivity testing, such as nslookup.exe and Test-NetConnection.\\n\\nValidate if you can resolve the following addresses through your Azure Purview account\\'s private IP addresses.\\n\\nWeb.Purview.Azure.com\\n\\n<YourPurviewAccountName>.Purview.Azure.com\\n\\nVerify network connectivity to your Azure Purview account by using the following PowerShell command:\\n\\npowershell\\n   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <YourPurviewAccountName>.Purview.Azure.com -Port 443\\n\\nVerify your cross-premises DNS configuration if you use your own DNS resolution infrastructure.\\n\\nFor more information about DNS settings for private endpoints, see Azure private endpoint DNS configuration.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\nTo set up Azure Purview by using Private Link, see Use private endpoints for your Azure Purview account.' metadata={'source': 'C:/Users/roshnipatil/OneDrive - Microsoft/GitHub_new/test/catalog-private-link-faqs.md'}\n",

(Default option)\\n\\nUse existing Azure Private DNS Zones. Use this option if you using a private endpoint in a hub-and-spoke model from a different subscription or even within the same subscription.\\n\\nUse your own DNS Servers if you do not use DNS forwarders and instead you manage A records directly in your on-premises DNS servers.\\n\\nOption 1 - Deploy new Azure Private DNS Zones\\n\\nTo enable internal name resolution, you can deploy the required Azure DNS Zones inside your Azure subscription where Azure Purview account is deployed.\\n\\nWhen you create portal and account private endpoints, the DNS CNAME resource records for Azure Purview is automatically updated to an alias in a subdomain with the prefix privatelink. \\nBy default, we also create a private DNS zone that corresponds to the privatelink subdomain for Azure Purview as privatelink.purview.azure.com including DNS A resource records for the private endpoints. \\nIf you enable ingestion private endpoints, additional DNS zones are required for managed resources.\\n\\nThe following table shows an example of Azure Private DNS zones and DNS A Records that are deployed as part of configuration of private endpoint for an Azure Purview account if you enable Private DNS integration during the deployment:\\n\\nPrivate endpoint  |Private endpoint associated to  |DNS Zone (new)  |A Record (example) |\\n|---------|---------|---------|---------|\\n|Account     |Azure Purview         |privatelink.purview.azure.com         |PurviewA         |\\n|Portal     |Azure Purview account          |privatelink.purview.azure.com        |Web         |\\n|Ingestion     |Purview managed Storage Account - Blob          |privatelink.blob.core.windows.net          |scaneastusabcd1234         |\\n|Ingestion   |Purview managed Storage Account - Queue         |privatelink.queue.core.windows.net         |scaneastusabcd1234         |\\n|Ingestion     |Purview managed Storage Account - Event Hub         |privatelink.servicebus.windows.net         |atlas-12345678-1234-1234-abcd-123456789abc         |\\n\\nWhen you resolve the Azure Purview endpoint URL from outside the virtual network with the private endpoint, it resolves to the public endpoint of Azure Purview. When resolved from the virtual network hosting the private endpoint, the Azure Purview endpoint URL resolves to the private endpoint\\'s IP address.\\n\\nAs an example, if an Azure Purview account name is \\'PurviewA\\', when it is resolved from outside the virtual network that hosts the private endpoint, it will be:\\n\\n| Name | Type | Value |\\n| ---------- | -------- | --------------- |\\n| PurviewA.purview.azure.com | CNAME | PurviewA.privatelink.purview.azure.com |\\n| PurviewA.privatelink.purview.azure.com | CNAME | \\\\<Purview public endpoint> |\\n| \\\\<Purview public endpoint> | A | \\\\<Purview public IP address> |\\n| Web.purview.azure.com | CNAME | \\\\<Purview public endpoint> |\\n\\nThe DNS resource records for PurviewA, when resolved in the virtual network hosting the private endpoint, will be:\\n\\n| Name | Type | Value |\\n| ---------- | -------- | --------------- |\\n| PurviewA.purview.azure.com | CNAME | PurviewA.privatelink.purview.azure.com |\\n| PurviewA.privatelink.purview.azure.com | A | \\\\<private endpoint IP address> |\\n| Web.purview.azure.com | CNAME | \\\\<private endpoint IP address> |\\n\\nOption 2 - Use existing Azure Private DNS Zones\\n\\nDuring the deployment of Azure purview private endpoints, you can choose Private DNS integration using existing Azure Private DNS Zones. This is common case for organizations where private endpoint is used for other services in Azure. In this case, during the deployment of private endpoints, make sure you select the existing DNS zones instead of creating new ones.\\n\\nThis also applies if your organization uses a central or hub subscription for all Azure Private DNS Zones.\\n\\nThe following list shows the required Azure DNS zones and A records for Purview private endpoints:\\n\\n[!NOTE]\\nUpdate all names with PurviewA,scaneastusabcd1234 and atlas-12345678-1234-1234-abcd-123456789abc with corresponding Azure resources name in your environment.

Azure Purview accounts created after August 18, 2021 are created with all these new features already available.\\n\\nAccounts created before August 18, 2021 (legacy accounts) are being automatically upgraded to include these features.\\n\\nIf you have a Purview account created before August 18, 2021, you\\'ll receive an email notification when your Purview account has been upgraded.\\n\\nThis document covers the changes you\\'ll see when your account is upgraded, and any steps you\\'ll need to take to use the new features.\\n\\nElastic data map\\n\\nUpgraded Azure Purview accounts use a new data map system that scales dynamically based on use: the elastic data map. Elastic data maps start at one capacity unit, and will add and reduce capacity units as needed.\\nThis new feature doesn\\'t affect how you interact with Purview directly, but does affect billing. It scales to the size you need to manage your data landscape, and you\\'re only billed for what you use.\\n\\nFor more information about the new elastic data map and how it\\'s billed, see our elastic data map page.\\n\\nFor billing details for all of Purview, see the pricing calculator.\\n\\nWhen your account is upgraded, you won\\'t need to make any changes to use the elastic data map. It\\'s automatically enabled.\\n\\nCollections\\n\\nCollections exist in legacy Purview accounts, but have new functionality and are managed in a different way in upgraded Purview accounts.\\n\\nLegacy collections were a way to organize data sources and artifacts in your Purview account. Collections are still used to customize your Purview data map to match your business landscape, but they now also include access control. Rather than controlling access at a high level outside your data map, through collections your access management experience will match your data map.\\n\\nCollections give you fine-grained control over your data sources, but also over discoverability. Users will only see assets in collections that they have access to, and so will only see the information they need.\\n\\nWhen your Purview account is upgraded, your collections will be updated as well. All your current assets will be migrated into these new collections. In the sections below, we\\'ll discuss where you can find your collections and your existing assets.\\n\\nLocate and manage collections\\n\\nTo find your new collections, we\\'ll start in the Purview Studio. You can find the studio by going to your Purview resource in the Azure portal and selecting the Open Purview Studio tile on the overview page.\\n\\nSelect Data Map > Collections from the left pane to open the collection management page.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"./media/concept-account-upgrade/find-collections.png\" alt-text=\"Screenshot of Purview studio window, opened to the Data Map, with the Collections tab selected.\" border=\"true\":::\\n\\nThere you\\'ll see the root collection, as well as all your existing collections.

      "page_content='title: Asset normalization\\ndescription: Learn how Azure Purview prevents duplicate assets in your data map through asset normalization\\nauthor: djpmsft\\nms.author: daperlov\\nms.service: purview\\nms.subservice: purview-data-catalog\\nms.topic: conceptual\\nms.date: 07/23/2021\\n\\nAsset normalization\\n\\nWhen ingesting assets into the Azure Purview data map, different sources updating the same data asset may send similar, but slightly different qualified names. While these qualified names represent the same asset, slight differences such as an extra character or different capitalization may cause these assets on the surface to appear different. To avoid storing duplicate entries and causing confusion when consuming the data catalog, Azure Purview applies normalization during ingestion to ensure all fully qualified names of the same entity type are in the same format.\\n\\nFor example, you scan in an Azure Blob with the qualified name https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myshare/folderA/folderB/my-file.parquet. This blob is also consumed by an Azure Data Factory pipeline which will then add lineage information to the asset.

      "page_content=\"title: Understand business glossary features in Azure Purview (preview)\\ndescription: This article explains what business glossary is in Azure Purview.\\nauthor: nayenama\\nms.author: nayenama\\nms.service: purview\\nms.subservice: purview-data-catalog\\nms.topic: conceptual\\nms.date: 11/13/2020\\n\\nUnderstand business glossary features in Azure Purview\\n\\nThis article provides an overview of the business glossary feature in Azure Purview.\\n\\nBusiness glossary\\n\\nA glossary provides vocabulary for business users. \\xa0It consists of business terms that can be related to each other and allows them to be categorized so that they can be understood in different contexts. These terms can be then mapped to assets like a database, tables, columns etc. This helps in abstracting the technical jargon associated with the data repositories and allows the business user to discover and work with data in the vocabulary that is more familiar to them.\\n\\nA business glossary is a collection of terms. Each term represents an object in an organization and it is highly likely that there are multiple terms representing the same object. A customer could also be referred to as client, purchaser, or buyer. These multiple terms have a relationship with each other. The relationship between these terms could one of the following:\\n\\nsynonyms - different terms with the same definition\\n\\nrelated - different name with similar definition\\n\\nThe same term can also imply multiple business objects. It is important that each term is well-defined and clearly understood within the organization.\\n\\nCustom attributes\\n\\nAzure Purview supports eight out-of-the-box attributes for any business glossary term:\\n- Name\\n- Definition\\n- Data stewards\\n- Data experts\\n- Acronym\\n- Synonyms\\n- Related terms\\n- Resources\\n\\nThese attributes cannot be edited or deleted. However, these attributes are not sufficient to completely define a term in an organization. To solve this problem, Purview provides a feature where you can define custom attributes for your glossary.\\n\\nTerm templates\\n\\nTerm Templates provides glossary custom attributes to be logically grouped together in catalog. The feature allows you to group all the relevant custom attributes together in a template and then apply the template while creating the glossary term.\\xa0For example, all finance- related custom attributes like cost center, profit center, accounting code can be grouped in a term template Finance Template and the Finance  template can be used to create financial glossary terms.\\n\\nAll the standard attributes are grouped in a system default template. Any term template that you create will contain these attributes along with any additional custom attributes created as part of template creation process.\\n\\nGlossary vs classification vs sensitivity labels\\n\\nWhile glossary terms, classifications and labels are annotations to a data asset, each one of them has a different meaning in the context of catalog.\\n\\nGlossary\\n\\nAs stated above, Business glossary term defines the business vocabulary for an organization and helps in bridging the gap between various departments in your company.\\n\\nClassifications\\n\\nClassifications are annotations that can be assigned to entities. The flexibility of classifications enables you to use them for multiple scenarios such as:\\n\\nunderstanding the nature of data stored in the data assets\\n\\ndefining access control policies\\n\\nPurview has more than 100 system classifiers today and you can define your own classifiers in catalog. As part of the scanning process, we automatically detect these classifications and apply them to data assets and schemas. However, you can override them at any point of time. The human overrides are never replaced by automated scans.\\n\\nSensitivity labels\\n\\nSensitivity labels are a type of annotation that allows you to classify and protect your organization's data, without hindering productivity and collaboration. Sensitivity labels are used to identify the categories of classification types within your organizational data, and group the policies that you wish to apply to each category. Purview makes use of the same sensitive information types as Microsoft 365, which allows you to stretch your existing security policies and protection across your entire content and data estate. The same labels can be shared across Microsoft Office products and data assets in Purview.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\nManage Term Templates\\n\\nBrowse the data catalog in Azure Purview\" metadata={'source': 'C:/Users/roshnipatil/OneDrive - Microsoft/GitHub_new/test/concept-business-glossary.md'}\n",

      "page_content='title: Elastic data map\\ndescription: This article explains the concepts of the Elastic Data Map in Azure Purview\\nauthor: chanuengg\\nms.author: csugunan\\nms.service: purview\\nms.subservice: purview-data-map\\nms.topic: conceptual\\nms.date: 08/18/2021\\nms.custom: template-concept\\n\\nElastic data map in Azure Purview\\n\\nAzure Purview Data Map provides the foundation for data discovery and data governance. It captures metadata about enterprise data present in analytics, software-as-a-service (SaaS), and operation systems in hybrid, on-premises, and multi-cloud environments. Purview Data Map automatically stays up to date with its built-in scanning and classification system. With the UI, developers can further programmatically interact with the Data Map using open-source Apache Atlas APIs.\\n\\nElastic data map\\n\\nAll Azure Purview accounts have a Data Map that can elastically grow starting at one capacity unit. They scale up and down based on request load within the elasticity window (check current limits). If you\\'re working with very large datasets or a massive environment and need higher capacity, you can request a larger capacity of elasticity window by completing the survey here.\\n\\nData map capacity unit\\n\\nElastic Data Map comes with operation throughput and storage components that are represented as Capacity Unit (CU). All Azure Purview accounts, by default, come with one capacity unit and elastically grow based on usage. Each Data Map capacity unit includes a throughput of 25 operations/sec and 2 GB of metadata storage limit.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nOperations are the throughput measure of the Purview Data Map. They include the Create, Read, Write, Update, and Delete operations on metadata stored in the Data Map. Some examples of operations are listed below:\\n\\nCreate an asset in Data Map\\n\\nAdd a relationship to an asset such as owner, steward, parent, lineage, etc.\\n\\nEdit an asset to add business metadata such as description, glossary term, etc.\\n\\nKeyword search returning results to search result page.\\n\\nStorage\\n\\nStorage is the second component of Data Map and includes technical, business, operational, and semantic metadata.\\n\\nThe technical metadata includes schema, data type, columns, and so on, that are discovered from Purview scanning. The business metadata includes automated (for example, promoted from Power BI datasets, or descriptions from SQL tables) and manual tagging of descriptions, glossary terms, and so on. Examples of semantic metadata include the collection mapping to data sources, or classifications. The operational metadata includes Data factory copy and data flow activity run status, and runs time.\\n\\nWork with elastic data map\\n\\nElastic Data Map with auto-scale – you\\'ll start with a Data Map as low as one capacity unit that can autoscale based on load. For most organizations, this feature will lead to increased savings and a lower price point for starting data governance projects. This feature will impact pricing.\\n\\nEnhanced scanning & ingestion – you can track and control the population of the data assets, and classification and lineage across both the scanning and ingestion processes. This feature will impact pricing.\\n\\nAdvanced resource set – you can reduce the size of the Data Map by processing partitioned files in a data lake such that it’s treated as a single data asset called as resource set. This is an optional feature that will impact pricing.\\n\\nScenario\\n\\nClaudia is an Azure admin at Contoso who wants to provision a new Azure Purview account from Azure portal. While provisioning, she doesn’t know the required size of Purview Data Map to support the future state of the platform. However, she knows that the Purview Data Map is billed by Capacity Units, which are affected by storage and operations throughput. She wants to provision the smallest Data Map to keep the cost low and grow the Data Map size elastically based on consumption.\\n\\nClaudia can create a Purview account with the default Data Map size of 1 capacity unit that can automatically scale up and down. The autoscaling feature also allows for capacity to be tuned based on intermittent or planned data bursts during specific periods. Claudia follows the next steps in provisioning experience to set up network configuration and completes the provisioning.\\n\\nIn the Azure monitor metrics page, Claudia can see the consumption of the Data Map storage and operations throughput. She can further set up an alert when the storage or operations throughput reaches a certain limit to monitor the consumption and billing of the new Purview account.\\n\\nData map billing\\n\\nCustomers are billed for one capacity unit (25 ops/sec and 2 GB) and extra billing is based on the consumption of each extra capacity unit rolled up to the hour. The Data Map operations scale in the increments of 25 operations/sec and metadata storage scales in the increments of 2 GB size. Purview Data Map can automatically scale up and down within the elasticity window (check current limits). However, to get the next level of elasticity window, a support ticket needs to be created.\\n\\nData Map capacity units come with a cap on operations throughput and storage. If storage exceeds the current capacity unit, customers are charged for the next capacity unit even if the operations throughput isn\\'t used. The below table shows the Data Map capacity unit ranges. Contact support if the Data Map capacity unit goes beyond 100 capacity unit.\\n\\n|Data Map Capacity Unit  |Operations/Sec throughput   |Storage capacity in GB|\\n|----------|-----------|------------|\\n|1    |25      |2     |\\n|2    |50      |4     |\\n|3    |75      |6     |\\n|4    |100     |8     |\\n|5    |125     |10    |\\n|6    |150     |12   |\\n|7    |175      |14     |\\n|8    |200     |16    |\\n|9    |225      |18    |\\n|10    |250     |20    |\\n|..   |..      |..     |\\n|100    |2500     |200   |\\n\\nBilling examples\\n\\nPurview Data Map’s operation throughput for the given hour is less than or equal to 25 Ops/Sec and storage size is 1 GB. Customers are billed for one capacity unit.\\n\\nPurview Data Map’s operation throughput for the given hour is less than or equal to 25 Ops/Sec and storage size is 3 GB. Customers are billed for two capacity unit.\\n\\nPurview Data Map’s operation throughput for the given hour is 50 Ops/Sec and storage size is 1 GB. Customers are billed for two capacity unit.\\n\\nPurview Data Map’s operation throughput for the given hour is 50 Ops/Sec and storage size is 5 GB. Customers are billed for three capacity unit.\\n\\nPurview Data Map’s operation throughput for the given hour is 250 Ops/Sec and storage size is 5 GB. Customers are billed for 10 capacity unit\\n\\nDetailed billing example\\n\\nThe Data Map billing example below shows a Data Map with growing metadata storage and variable operations per second over a six-hour window from 12 PM to 6 PM. The red line in the graph is operations per second consumption, and the blue dotted line is metadata storage consumption over this six-hour window:\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"./media/concept-elastic-data-map/operations-and-metadata.png\" alt-text=\"Chart depicting number of operations and growth of metadata over time.\":::\\n\\nEach Data Map capacity unit supports 25 operations/second and 2 GB of metadata storage. The Data Map is billed on an hourly basis. You are billed for the maximum Data Map capacity unit needed within the hour. At times, you may need more operations/second within the hour, and this will increase the number of capacity units needed within that hour. At other times, your operations/second usage may be low, but you may still need a large volume of metadata storage. The metadata storage is what determines how many capacity units you need within the hour.\\n\\nThe table below shows the maximum number of operations/second and metadata storage used per hour for this billing example:\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"./media/concept-elastic-data-map/billing-table.png\" alt-text=\"Table depicting max number of operations and growth of metadata over time.\":::\\n\\nBased on the Data Map operations/second and metadata storage consumption in this period, this Data Map would be billed for 20 capacity-unit hours over this six-hour period (1 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 3):\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"./media/concept-elastic-data-map/billing-capacity-hours.png\" alt-text=\"Table depicting number of CU hours over time.\":::\\n\\n[!Important]\\nPurview Data Map can automatically scale up and down within the elasticity window (check current limits). To get the next level of the elasticity window, a support ticket needs to be created.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nWith elastic Data Map, Purview provides low-cost barrier for customers to start their data governance journey.\\nPurview DataMap can grow elastically with pay as you go model starting from as small as 1 Capacity unit.\\nCustomers don’t need to worry about choosing the correct Data Map size for their data estate at provision time and deal with platform migrations in the future due to size limits.\\n\\nNext Steps\\n\\nCreate an Azure Purview account\\n\\nPurview Pricing' metadata={'source': 'C:/Users/roshnipatil/OneDrive - Microsoft/GitHub_new/test/concept-elastic-data-map.md'}\n",

The feature provides customers, a single pane of glass view into their catalog and further aims to provide specific insights to the data source administrators, business users, data stewards, data officer and, security administrators. Currently, Purview has the following Insights reports that will be available to customers at public preview.\\n\\nAsset Insights\\n\\nThis report gives a bird\\'s eye view of your data estate, and its distribution by source type, by classification and by file size as some of the dimensions. This report caters to different types of users who may be managing the Purview account and running scans or business users who may be interested to know how many assets exist with a certain classification within their organization\\'s data estate.\\n\\nThe report provides broad insights through graphs and KPIs and later deep dive into specific anomalies such as misplaced files. The report also supports an end-to-end customer experience, where customer can view count of assets with a specific classification, can breakdown the information by source types and top folders, and can also view the list of assets for further investigation.\\n\\nScan Insights\\n\\nThe report enables administrators to understand overall health of the scans - how many succeeded, how many failed, how many canceled. This report gives a status update on scans that have been executed in the Purview account within a time period of last seven days or last 30 days.\\n\\nThe report also allows administrators to deep dive and explore which scans failed and on what specific source types. To further enable users to investigate, the report helps them navigate into the scan history page within the \"Sources\" experience.\\n\\nGlossary Insights\\n\\nThis report gives the business users and data stewards a status report on glossary. Users can view this report to understand distribution of glossary terms by status, learn how many glossary terms are attached to assets and how many are not yet attached to any asset. Business users can also learn about completeness of their glossary terms.\\n\\nThis report summarizes top items that a business user or data steward needs to focus on, to create a complete and usable glossary for his/her organization. Users can also navigate into the \"Glossary\" experience from \"Glossary Insights\" experience, to make changes on a specific glossary term.\\n\\nClassification Insights\\n\\nThis report provides details about where classified data is located, the classifications found during a scan, and a drilldown to the classified files themselves. It enables security administrators to understand the types of information found in their organization\\'s data estate.\\n\\nIn Azure Purview, classifications are similar to subject tags, and are used to mark and identify content of a specific type in your data estate.\\n\\nUse the Classification Insights report to identify content with specific classifications and understand required actions, such as adding additional security to the repositories, or moving content to a more secure location.\\n\\nFor more information, see Classification insights about your data from Azure Purview.\\n\\nSensitivity Labeling Insights\\n\\nThis report provides details about the sensitivity labels found during a scan, as well as a drilldown to the labeled files themselves.

      "page_content='title: Understanding resource sets\\ndescription: This article explains what resource sets are and how Azure Purview creates them.\\nauthor: djpmsft\\nms.author: daperlov\\nms.service: purview\\nms.subservice: purview-data-catalog\\nms.topic: conceptual\\nms.date: 07/23/2021\\n\\nUnderstanding resource sets\\n\\nThis article helps you understand how Azure Purview uses resource sets to map data assets to logical resources.\\n\\nBackground info\\n\\nAt-scale data processing systems typically store a single table on a disk as multiple files. This concept is represented in Azure Purview by using resource sets. A resource set is a single object in the catalog that represents a large number of assets in storage.\\n\\nFor example, suppose your Spark cluster has persisted a DataFrame into an Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2 data source. Although in Spark the table looks like a single logical resource, on the disk there are likely thousands of Parquet files, each of which represents a partition of the total DataFrame\\'s contents. IoT data and web log data have the same challenge. Imagine you have a sensor that outputs log files several times a second. It won\\'t take long until you have hundreds of thousands of log files from that single sensor.\\n\\nTo address the challenge of mapping large numbers of data assets to a single logical resource, Azure Purview uses resource sets.\\n\\nHow Azure Purview detects resource sets\\n\\nAzure Purview supports detecting resource sets in Azure Blob Storage, ADLS Gen1, ADLS Gen2, Azure Files, and Amazon S3.\\n\\nAzure Purview automatically detects resource sets when scanning. This feature looks at all of the data that\\'s ingested via scanning and compares it to a set of defined patterns.\\n\\nFor example, suppose you scan a data source whose URL is https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/machinesets/23/foo.parquet. Azure Purview looks at the path segments and determines if they match any built-in patterns. It has built-in patterns for GUIDs, numbers, date formats, localization codes (for example, en-us), and so on. In this case, the number pattern matches 23. Azure Purview assumes that this file is part of a resource set named https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/machinesets/{N}/foo.parquet.\\n\\nOr, for a URL like https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/weblogs/en_au/23.json, Azure Purview matches both the localization pattern and the number pattern, producing a resource set named https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/weblogs/{LOC}/{N}.json.\\n\\nUsing this strategy, Azure Purview would map the following resources to the same resource set, https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/weblogs/{LOC}/{N}.json:\\n\\nhttps://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/weblogs/cy_gb/1004.json\\n\\nhttps://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/weblogs/cy_gb/234.json\\n\\nhttps://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/weblogs/de_Ch/23434.json\\n\\nFile types that Azure Purview will not detect as resource sets\\n\\nPurview intentionally doesn\\'t try to classify most document file types like Word, Excel, or PDF as Resource Sets. The exception is CSV format since that is a common partitioned file format.\\n\\nHow Azure Purview scans resource sets\\n\\nWhen Azure Purview detects resources that it thinks are part of a resource set, it switches from a full scan to a sample scan. In a sample scan, it opens only a subset of the files that it thinks are in the resource set. For each file it does open, it uses its schema and runs its classifiers. Azure Purview then finds the newest resource among the opened resources and uses that resource\\'s schema and classifications in the entry for the entire resource set in the catalog.\\n\\nWhat Azure Purview stores about resource sets\\n\\nIn addition to single schema and classifications, Azure Purview stores the following information about resource sets:\\n\\nData from the latest partition resource it deep scanned.\\n\\nAggregate information about the partition resources that make up the resource set.\\n\\nA partition count that shows how many partition resources it found.\\n\\nA schema count that shows how many unique schemas it found in the sample set it did deep scans on. This value is either a number between 1–5, or for values greater than 5, 5+.\\n\\nA list of partition types when more than a single partition type is included in the resource set. For example, an IoT sensor might output both XML and JSON files, although both are logically part of the same resource set.\\n\\nBuilt-in resource set patterns\\n\\nAzure Purview supports the following resource set patterns. These patterns can appear as a name in a directory or as part of a file name.\\n\\nRegex-based patterns\\n\\n| Pattern Name | Display Name | Description |\\n|--------------|--------------|-------------|\\n| Guid         | {GUID}       | A globally unique identifier as defined in RFC 4122 |\\n| Number       | {N}          | One or more digits |\\n| Date/Time Formats | {Year}{Month}{Day}{N}     | We support various date/time formats but all are represented with {Year}[delimiter]{Month}[delimiter]{Day} or series of {N}s. |\\n| 4ByteHex     | {HEX}        | A 4-digit HEX number. |\\n| Localization | {LOC}        | A language tag as defined in BCP 47, both - and _ names are supported (for example, en_ca and en-ca) |\\n\\nComplex patterns\\n\\n| Pattern Name | Display Name | Description |\\n|--------------|--------------|-------------|\\n| SparkPath    | {SparkPartitions} | Spark partition file identifier |\\n| Date(yyyy/mm/dd)InPath  | {Year}/{Month}/{Day} | Year/month/day pattern spanning multiple folders |\\n\\nHow resource sets are displayed in the Azure Purview Catalog\\n\\nWhen Azure Purview matches a group of assets into a resource set, it attempts to extract the most useful information to use as a display name in the catalog. Some examples of the default naming convention applied:\\n\\nExample 1\\n\\nQualified name: https://myblob.blob.core.windows.net/sample-data/name-of-spark-output/{SparkPartitions}\\n\\nDisplay name: \"name of spark output\"\\n\\nExample 2\\n\\nQualified name: https://myblob.blob.core.windows.net/my-partitioned-data/{Year}-{Month}-{Day}/{N}-{N}-{N}-{N}/{GUID}\\n\\nDisplay name: \"my partitioned data\"\\n\\nExample 3\\n\\nQualified name: https://myblob.blob.core.windows.net/sample-data/data{N}.csv\\n\\nDisplay name: \"data\"\\n\\nCustomizing resource set grouping using pattern rules\\n\\nWhen scanning a storage account, Azure Purview uses a set of defined patterns to determine if a group of assets is a resource set. In some cases, Azure Purview\\'s resource set grouping may not accurately reflect your data estate. These issues can include:\\n\\nIncorrectly marking an asset as a resource set\\n\\nPutting an asset into the wrong resource set\\n\\nIncorrectly marking an asset as not being a resource set\\n\\nTo customize or override how Azure Purview detects which assets are grouped as resource sets and how they are displayed within the catalog, you can define pattern rules in the management center. For step-by-step instructions and syntax, please see resource set pattern rules.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\nTo get started with Azure Purview, see Quickstart: Create an Azure Purview account.' metadata={'source': 'C:/Users/roshnipatil/OneDrive - Microsoft/GitHub_new/test/concept-resource-sets.md'}\n",

These features connect your Purview account to your sources to populate the data map and data catalog so you can begin exploring and managing your data through Purview.\\n\\nScanning\\n\\nAfter data sources are registered in your Purview account, the next step is to scan the data sources. The scanning process establishes a connection to the data source and captures technical metadata like names, file size, columns, and so on. It also extracts schema for structured data sources, applies classifications on schemas, and applies sensitivity labels if your Purview account is connected to a Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance Center (SCC). The scanning process can be triggered to run immediately or can be scheduled to run on a periodic basis to keep your Purview account up to date.\\n\\nFor each scan there are customizations you can apply so that you're only scanning your sources for the information you need.\\n\\nChoose an authentication method for your scans\\n\\nPurview is secure by default. No passwords or secrets are stored directly in Purview, so you’ll need to choose an authentication method for your sources. There are four possible ways to authenticate your Purview account, but not all methods are supported for each data source.\\n - Managed Identity\\n - Service Principal\\n - SQL Authentication\\n - Account Key or Basic Authentication\\n\\nWhenever possible, a Managed Identity is the preferred authentication method because it eliminates the need for storing and managing credentials for individual data sources. This can greatly reduce the time you and your team spend setting up and troubleshooting authentication for scans. When you enable a managed identity for your Purview account, an identity is created in Azure Active Directory and is tied to the lifecycle of your account.\\n\\nScope your scan\\n\\nWhen scanning a source, you have a choice to scan the entire data source or choose only specific entities (folders/tables) to scan. Available options depend on the source you're scanning, and can be defined for both one-time and scheduled scans.\\n\\nFor example, when creating and running a scan for an Azure SQL Database, you can choose which tables to scan, or select the entire database.\\n\\nScan rule set\\n\\nA scan rule set determines the kinds of information a scan will look for when it's running against one of your sources. Available rules depend on the kind of source you're scanning, but include things like the file types you should scan, and the kinds of classifications you need.\\n\\nThere are system scan rule sets already available for many data source types, but you can also create your own scan rule sets to tailor your scans to your organization.\\n\\nSchedule your scan\\n\\nPurview gives you a choice of scanning weekly or monthly at a specific time you choose. Weekly scans may be appropriate for data sources with structures that are actively under development or frequently change. Monthly scanning is more appropriate for data sources that change infrequently. A good best practice is to work with the administrator of the source you want to scan to identify a time when compute demands on the source are low.\\n\\nHow scans detect deleted assets\\n\\nAn Azure Purview catalog is only aware of the state of a data store when it runs a scan. For the catalog to know if a file, table, or container was deleted, it compares the last scan output against the current scan output. For example, suppose that the last time you scanned an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account, it included a folder named folder1. When the same account is scanned again, folder1 is missing. Therefore, the catalog assumes the folder has been deleted.\\n\\nDetecting deleted files\\n\\nThe logic for detecting missing files works for multiple scans by the same user as well as by different users. For example, suppose a user runs a one-time scan on a Data Lake Storage Gen2 data store on folders A, B, and C. Later, a different user in the same account runs a different one-time scan on folders C, D, and E of the same data store. Because folder C was scanned twice, the catalog checks it for possible deletions. Folders A, B, D, and E, however, were scanned only once, and the catalog won't check them for deleted assets.\\n\\nTo keep deleted files out of your catalog, it's important to run regular scans. The scan interval is important, because the catalog can't detect deleted assets until another scan is run. So, if you run scans once a month on a particular store, the catalog can't detect any deleted data assets in that store until you run the next scan a month later.\\n\\nWhen you enumerate large data stores like Data Lake Storage Gen2, there are multiple ways (including enumeration errors and dropped events) to miss information. A particular scan might miss that a file was created or deleted. So, unless the catalog is certain a file was deleted, it won't delete it from the catalog. This strategy means there can be errors when a file that doesn't exist in the scanned data store still exists in the catalog. In some cases, a data store might need to be scanned two or three times before it catches certain deleted assets.\\n\\n[!NOTE]\\nAssets that are marked for deletion are deleted after a successful scan. Deleted assets might continue to be visible in your catalog for some time before they are processed and removed.\\n\\nIngestion\\n\\nThe technical metadata or classifications identified by the scanning process are then sent to Ingestion. The ingestion process is responsible for populating the data map and is managed by Purview.  Ingestion analyses the input from scan, applies resource set patterns, populates available lineage information, and then loads the data map automatically. Assets/schemas can be discovered or curated only after ingestion is complete. So, if your scan is completed but you haven't seen your assets in the data map or catalog, you'll need to wait for the ingestion process to finish.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\nFor more information, or for specific instructions for scanning sources, follow the links below.\\n\\nTo understand resource sets, see our resource sets article.\\n\\nHow to register and scan an Azure SQL Database\\n\\nLineage in Azure Purview\" metadata={'source': 'C:/Users/roshnipatil/OneDrive - Microsoft/GitHub_new/test/concept-scans-and-ingestion.md'}\n",

Search is a core platform capability of Purview, that powers the data discovery and data use governance experiences in an organization.\\n\\nSearch\\n\\nThe Purview search experience is powered by a managed search index. After a data source is registered with Purview, its metadata is indexed by the search service to allow easy discovery. The index provides search relevance capabilities and completes search requests by querying millions of metadata assets. Search helps you to discover, understand, and use the data to get the most value out of it.\\n\\nThe search experience in Purview is a three stage process:\\n\\nThe search box shows the history containing recently used keywords and assets.\\n\\nWhen you begin typing the keystrokes, the search suggests the matching keywords and assets.\\n\\nThe search result page is shown with assets matching the keyword entered.\\n\\nReduce the time to discover data\\n\\nData discovery is the first step for a data analytics or data governance workload for data consumers. Data discovery can be time consuming, because you may not know where to find the data that you want. Even after finding the data, you may have doubts about whether or not you can trust the data and take a dependencies on it.\\n\\nThe goal of search in Azure Purview is to speed up the process of data discovery by providing gestures, to quickly find the data that matters.\\n\\nRecent search and suggestions\\n\\nMany times, you may be working on multiple projects at the same time. To make it easier to resume previous projects, Purview search provides the ability to see recent search keywords and suggestions. Also, you can manage the recent search history by selecting View all from the search box drop-down.\\n\\nFilters\\n\\nFilters (also known as facets) are designed to complement searching. Filters are shown in the search result page. The filters in the search result page include classification, sensitivity label, data source, and owners. Users can select specific values in a filter to see only matching data assets, and restrict the search result to the matching assets.\\n\\nHit highlighting\\n\\nMatching keywords in the search result page are highlighted to make it easier to identify why a data asset was returned by search. The keyword match can occur in multiple fields such as data asset name, description, and owner.\\n\\nIt may not be obvious why a data asset is included in search, even with hit highlighting enabled. All properties are searched by default. Therefore, a data asset might be returned because of a match on a column-level property. And because multiple users can annotate the data assets with their own classifications and descriptions, not all metadata is displayed in the list of search results.\\n\\nSort\\n\\nUsers have two options to sort the search results. They can sort by the name of the asset or by default search relevance.\\n\\nSearch relevance\\n\\nRelevance is the default sort order in the search result page. The search relevance finds documents that include the search keyword (some or all). Assets that contain many instances of the search keyword are ranked higher. Also, custom scoring mechanisms are constantly tuned to improve search relevance.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\nQuickstart: Create an Azure Purview account in the Azure portal\\n\\nQuickstart: Create an Azure Purview account using Azure PowerShell/Azure CLI\\n\\nQuickstart: Use Purview Studio' metadata={'source': 'C:/Users/roshnipatil/OneDrive - Microsoft/GitHub_new/test/concept-search.md'}\n",

It also describes the creation of custom classification rules that let you find specified data throughout your data estate.\\n\\nDefault system classifications\\n\\nThe Azure Purview Data Catalog provides a large set of default system classifications that represent typical personal data types that you might have in your data estate. For the entire list of available system classifications, see Supported classifications in Azure Purview.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/classification.png\" alt-text=\"select classification\" border=\"true\":::\\n\\nYou also have the ability to create custom classifications, if any of the default classifications don\\'t meet your needs.\\n\\n[!Note]\\nOur data sampling rules are applied to both system and custom classifications.\\n\\nSteps to create a custom classification\\n\\nTo create a custom classification, follow these steps:\\n\\nFrom your catalog, select Management Center from the left menu.\\n\\nSelect Classifications under Metadata management.\\n\\nSelect + New\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/new-classification.png\" alt-text=\"New classification\" border=\"true\":::\\n\\nThe\\xa0Add new classification\\xa0pane opens, where you can give your\\nclassification a name and a description. It\\'s good practice to use a name-spacing convention, such as your company name.classification name.\\n\\nThe Microsoft system classifications are grouped under the reserved MICROSOFT. namespace. An example is\\xa0MICROSOFT.GOVERNMENT.US.SOCIAL_SECURITY_NUMBER.\\n\\nThe name of your classification must start with a letter followed by a sequence of letters, numbers, and period (.) or underscore characters. No spaces are allowed. As you type, the UX automatically generates a friendly name. This friendly name is what users see when you apply it to an asset in the catalog.\\n\\nTo keep the name short, the system creates the friendly name based on\\nthe following logic:\\n\\nAll but the last two segments of the namespace are trimmed.\\n\\nThe casing is adjusted so that the first letter of each word is capitalized.\\n\\nAll underscores (_) are replaced with spaces.\\n\\nAs an example, if you named your classification\\xa0CONTOSO.HR.EMPLOYEE_ID, the friendly name is stored\\nin the system as\\xa0Hr.Employee ID.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/contoso-hr-employee-id.png\" alt-text=\"Contoso.hr.employee_id\" border=\"true\":::\\n\\nSelect\\xa0OK, and your new classification is added to your\\nclassification list.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/custom-classification.png\" alt-text=\"Custom classification\" border=\"true\":::\\n\\nSelecting the classification in the list opens the classification\\ndetails page. Here, you find all the details about the classification.\\n\\nThese details include the count of how many instances there are, the formal name, associated classification rules (if any), and the owner name.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/select-classification.png\" alt-text=\"Select classification\" border=\"true\":::\\n\\nCustom classification rules\\n\\nThe catalog service provides a set of default classification rules, which are used by the scanner to automatically detect certain data types. You can also add your own custom classification rules to detect other types of data that you might be interested in finding across your data estate. This capability can be powerful when you\\'re trying to find data within your data estate.\\n\\nAs an example, let\\\\\\'s say that a company named Contoso has employee IDs that are standardized throughout the company with the word \\\\\"Employee\\\\\" followed by a GUID to create\\xa0EMPLOYEE{GUID}. For example, one instance of an employee ID looks like\\xa0EMPLOYEE9c55c474-9996-420c-a285-0d0fc23f1f55.\\n\\nContoso can configure the scanning system to find instances of these IDs by creating a custom classification rule. They can supply a regular expression that matches the data pattern, in this\\ncase,\\xa0\\\\^Employee\\\\[A-Za-z0-9\\\\]{8}-\\\\[A-Za-z0-9\\\\]{4}-\\\\[A-Za-z0-9\\\\]{4}-\\\\[A-Za-z0-9\\\\]{4}-\\\\[A-Za-z0-9\\\\]{12}\\\\$.\\xa0Optionally,\\nif the data usually is in a column that they know the name of, such as Employee_ID or EmployeeID, they can add a column pattern regular expression to make the scan even more accurate. An example regex is\\xa0Employee_ID\\\\|EmployeeID.\\n\\nThe scanning system can then use this rule to examine the actual data in the column and the column name to try to identify every instance of where the employee ID pattern is found.\\n\\nSteps to create a custom classification rule\\n\\nTo create a custom classification rule:\\n\\nCreate a custom classification by following the instructions in the previous section. You will add this custom classification in the classification rule configuration so that the system applies it when it finds a match in the column.\\n\\nSelect the\\xa0Management Center\\xa0icon.\\n\\nSelect the\\xa0Classifications rules\\xa0section.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/classificationrules.png\" alt-text=\"Classification rules tile\" border=\"true\":::\\n\\nSelect New.\\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/create-a-custom-classification-and-classification-rule/newclassificationrule.png\" alt-text=\"Add new classification rule\" border=\"true\":::\\n\\nThe New classification rule dialog box opens.
